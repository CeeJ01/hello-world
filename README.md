# hello-world
My first project on GitHub. It will be a place for storing ideas, resources and shareing/discussing ideas.

Hi there! My name is CJ. I am here to learn web development. I am currently working through the Odin Project to learn how I can one day hopefully become a web developer. Languages I will be focusing on are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby/Rails. I have some experience with Java, Python, and C so I may work on those languages again at some point on here. I look forward to learning about so much in the vast and creative world of Web Development!
